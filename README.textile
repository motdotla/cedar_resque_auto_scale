h1. CedarResqueAutoScale for Heroku

p. Disclaimer: This is heavily copied from "verboselogging":http://verboselogging.com/2010/07/30/auto-scale-your-resque-workers-on-heroku

p. I have made the following changes:
* adjust to work on Heroku's Cedar stack
* require the password to passed in Base64 so that you are not storing it as plain text in your heroku config vars

h2. Usage

1. Drop into your lib/ folder

2. Extend your resque worker like the following example:

<pre>
  class GumLinkScraper
    extend CedarResqueAutoScale unless Sinatra::Application.test? || Sinatra::Application.development?

    @queue = :gum_link_scraper
    
    def self.perform
      GumLink.queued.each { |gum_link| gum_link.scrape! }
    end
  end
</pre>
